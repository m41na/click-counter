# Scrum away

## The chicken or the egg - which came first? 

That's a difficult question because it rises some implicit pre-suppositions:

1. that there must have been a creator who determined the ordering since just by themselves, neither would have existed before the other
2. that there must have been a spontaneous event where one of the two suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and from which the other then came from

Both pre-suppositions are unabashedly wild and they force us to give up certain faculties of rational thought and to just believe in either one. This is the quintessential struggle of mankind.
